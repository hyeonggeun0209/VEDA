Oh, yesterday seems so far away
Where did it go?
All of the nights, all the time we spent together
Oh, yesterday, seems so far away
Someday, I'm running out of time
I'll see your picture in my mind
I'll keep our love frozen in time
Oh, when I get old, I'll be looking back
Wishing it could last forever
Oh, yesterday, seems so far away
