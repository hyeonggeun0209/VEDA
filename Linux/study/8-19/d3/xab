Oh, when I get old
I'll be looking back, wishing it could last forever
Oh, yesterday, seems so far away
When I get old, that's all I wanna think about
I probably shouldn't say this out loud
High hopes, big dreams and a little scared
Way too na√Øve, thinking you always be mine and never leave my side
At least these memories never say goodbye
Oh, when I get old, I'll be looking back
Wishing it could last forever
