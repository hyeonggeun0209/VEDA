Oh, when I get old
I'll be looking back, wishing it could last forever
Oh, yesterday, seems so far away
Long dress, no shoes
Summer nights, golden and blue
It feels just like we're stuck inside a picture frame
These memories never fade away, oh
Whisper to me, we got the world right at our feet
And I just wanna sit right here and look at you
That's probably all I ever do
Oh, when I get old
I'll be looking back, wishing it could last forever
Oh, yesterday, seems so far away
When I get old, that's all I wanna think about
I probably shouldn't say this out loud
High hopes, big dreams and a little scared
Way too na√Øve, thinking you always be mine and never leave my side
At least these memories never say goodbye
Oh, when I get old, I'll be looking back
Wishing it could last forever
