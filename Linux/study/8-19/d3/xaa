Oh, when I get old
I'll be looking back, wishing it could last forever
Oh, yesterday, seems so far away
Long dress, no shoes
Summer nights, golden and blue
It feels just like we're stuck inside a picture frame
These memories never fade away, oh
Whisper to me, we got the world right at our feet
And I just wanna sit right here and look at you
That's probably all I ever do
